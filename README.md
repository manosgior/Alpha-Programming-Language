# Alpha-Programming-Language
Alpha Programming Language based on Delta (https://projects.ics.forth.gr/hci/files/plang/Delta/Delta.html) implemented in C++. It was created as the main project of the undergraduate course CS-340 (Languages and Compilers, https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy340/).

The languge resembles a subset of Javascript, and runs on a virtual machine (the coding of which was the last part of the project).

The team consisted of three members (Emmanouil Giortamis https://github.com/manosgior, Georgios Lydakis https://github.com/geomlyd and Anastasios Livanidis https://github.com/AlivasGR) and the work was more or less equally distributed. This repo is a public read-only copy of the original, created for showcasing examples of our work for CV purposes.
